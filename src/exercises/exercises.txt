**** Exercises week 1 ***

Welcome to exercises 1! Please read the below carefully.

General instructions
----------------------
- Files for the exercises are in directory src/exercises (i.e. files you write Java code in).
- Last in the file header comment (the gray text) for each file is a "See: ..." reference.
  This means there are code samples in the src/samples directory to help you.
  The samples are all possible to run, modify, experiment, etc.
- If stuck, confused or problems to understand, ASK in the exercise and lab sessions!

Exercises
---------

1.  See Ex1BMI. Implement a program to calculate body mass index. Program should look like this when run:

    Please, enter your weight (kg) > 76
    Please, enter your height (m) > 1.85
    BMI = 22.205989773557338

2.  See Ex2Methods. Implement the methods (uncomment one row at a time). Program run should output the following when run:

    true
    true
    true
    true
    true
    true
    true
    Winner is Olle

3.  See Ex3ClassesObjects. Use the class Hero to create 2 heroes (hero objects) to be used as follows:

    What's the name of the hero 1? > Hercules      (input data)
    How strong is Hercules > 34
    What's the name of the hero 2? > Atlas
    How strong is Atlas > 45
    Atlas is stronger

    NOTE: When reading a number the scanner will leave the last char (the enter char, '\n') because
    it can not be part of any number. To get rid of the enter char use an extra sc.readLine().
    Else strange behaviour for program (seems like it skips an input).

4.  See Ex4ReadPlayers. Implement the exercise to run like:

    How many players? > 2
    Name for player 1 > Olle
    Name for player 2 > Fia
    Players are:
    Name Olle points 0         (A player by default has 0 points)
    Name Fia points 0

    a) Add a constructor to the Player class. The constructor should make it possible to set
    the name of the player when the player object is created.

    b) Implement methods inputPlayers() and outputPlayers(). Use the constructor when initializing!

    AGAIN: When mixing numerical and text input you have to remove the trailing enter key
    ('\n') in input stream when reading numbers. Use an extra sc.readLine() to fix.

5.  See Ex5Theory. Just uncomment (possibly run) and explain result (write it here)
    1.  (write short explanation)
    2.
    3.
    4.
    5.

6.  See ex6useaclass directory. Implement the class Rational so that all tests
    in Ex1TestRational pass.

    TIP: Always store rationals in shortest form,
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm

    TIP: It's possible to generate the equals and hashCode methods (possibly modify
    and/or clean up a bit)

7.  See ex7usemoreclasses. Implement classes Point and Triangle so that all test
    in Ex7TestPointTriangle passes. Triangle should use Point and should use Herons
    formula to calculate the area, See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heron%27s_formula

8.  See directory ex8hangman. Implement a text based object oriented version of the Hangman game
    See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game).

    - All classes needed are there.
    - Break down and decide which data and which method in which classes.
    - The main class, with the game loop is CLI (also contains all IO)
    - Let CLI do calls on the HangMan class (only) to do the work. Hangman will in
      turn delegate to other objects to fulfill their part of the work.
    - Make a sketch discuss with assistants

    A run of the game outputs:

    Welcome to HangMan, try to guess the word! It's 7 char long
    Enter a char > i

    i _ _ _ _ _ _
    Enter a char > x
    ---|

    i _ _ _ _ _ _
    Enter a char > n
    ---|

    i n _ _ _ n _
    Enter a char > x
    ---|
       |

    i n _ _ _ n _
    Enter a char > x
    ---|
       |
       O

    ... (etc)

    i n _ _ _ n _
    Enter a char > x
    ---|
       |
       O
      /|\
      /
    i n _ _ _ n _
    Enter a char > x
    ---|
       |
       O
      /|\
      / \

    i n _ _ _ n _
    Sorry you lost. Word was: instans

    (if win: Congratulation you made it! Word was ..)
